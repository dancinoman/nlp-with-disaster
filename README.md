The F-score (or F1 score) is a metric used in classification tasks to evaluate a model's accuracy by balancing two important aspects: <br>
precision and recall. It is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class might dominate, making accuracy a misleading measure of model performance.
